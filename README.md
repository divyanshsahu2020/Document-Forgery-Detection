# Document-Forgery-Detection

DESCRIPTION - This project aims at building a system that can accurately identify fraudulant or forged documents from genuine ones. This model is designed to work with a wide variety of document types, including passports, driver's licenses, identity cards and bank statements.
The model utilizes a combination of convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, and spatial attention mechanisms to enhance its performance in detecting forged regions in images. 
Autoencoders are neural network architectures used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. In this model, autoencoders are used to capture the underlying patterns and structures in genuine documents. Any discrepancies between the original document and its reconstructed version can indicate forgery or tampering.

PYTHON LIBRARIES USED - TensorFlow, os, cv2, NumPy, SkLearn, Matplotlib, Keras
